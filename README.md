# quadrangulations
all quadrangulations on 14 vertices.

Plantri only focuses on generating graph embeddings, and for the 3-connected situation, the embedding isomorphism and abstract graph isomorphism are consistent, 
but for vertex connectivity less than 3, the situation is essentially different.
I all generated 15,882 non-isomorphic embeddings of quadrangulations on 14 vertices by plantri. Further elimination of abstract isomorphic graphs is then necessary.

A total of 14805 non-isomorphic quadrangulations on 14 vertices were screened out.
